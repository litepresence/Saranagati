# Saranagati

### The First English Translation

You are holding a book of fire.

These fifty-nine songs are not poetry.

They are the recorded heartbeats of a soul who discovered, in the year 1893, that
the only thing left to do in this world is to fall at the feet of Śrī Śrī Gaura-Nitāi,
weep until the false “I” dissolves, and beg to be allowed to serve Śrīmatī
Rādhārāṇī as Her insignificant maidservant forever.

That soul was Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, the nineteenth-century architect of the
modern Gauḍīya renaissance.

He wrote these songs in a tiny room in Godrumadvīpa, Navadvīpa-dhāma, after
years of scraping the bottom of material existence, after tasting every philosophy,
every practice, every promise the world offers, and finding them all dust.
One night the dam broke.

He sat alone, tears streaming, and the songs poured out like blood from a fresh
wound.

He called the collection Śaraṇāgati: Complete Surrender.
